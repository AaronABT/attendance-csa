                                     and marginalized sections of the society. This is undertaken so as to facilitate sustainable changes in the lives of the poor and the oppressed through active

                DISHA is the pristine wing born in CSA Kengeri Campus. It is unlike any other wing of CSA, as it provides the volunteers to apply their classroom knowledge (of various disciplines) towards socially relevant problems.

These problems would be taken as projects with an ideal tenure of a semester. The projects can be of research or social nature. Through these projects, volunteers work for a better tomorrow.

Naataka Naataka, the words that lie at the heart of the theater wing of CSA, Drishti. Drishti means vision and we as a wing stand for the vision of change. The wing chants and roams the streets to sensitize, impact and create awareness about different social issues. Art is the best form of expression and drishti as a team aim to provide a voice for change. We work closely to sow that seed of change in every individual that watches us on the streets. From street theatre to mime to musicals Drishti is about hearing the unheard voices.

Drishti is no acting, no scripts, no sets it’s all about changing mindsets. Drishti doesn't perform to win accolades but rather we perform to reform.

The “Educate a Child” Sponsorship Programme was the first initiative of CSA to create a sense of responsibility among the student community at CHRIST (Deemed to be University). It was started in the year 1999 by supporting 50 children. With the contributions made by them, today CSA is able to cater to the educational needs of about more than 800+ children annually.

Under this programme, one can sponsor the children for the educational and developmental needs with an annual donation/contribution of 4000 Indian Rupees (65 USD) for a year.

The Projects are spread across three different slum areas in Bengaluru, namely 3D Project at Janakiram near Kammanahalli, Vriddhi Project at L.R Nagar, and Ambedkar Nagar in Koramangala.
